During development, I didn't run into any issues, but when I deployed, the server was not correctly fetching form the database, and the session would timeout when trying to POST to the database. After careful analysis of my code, I noticed the following issues: I was connecting to the database within one of my client components, as well as the app layout, additionally I was forgetting to connect to the database within each server action function, and finally I had to revalidate /users and /artists after each server action, so that the cached data would be purged."

The program also calculates the sum and average of the numbers inputted by the user, and displays their value to the output. This program intentionally incorporates the use of macros to handle getting user input and displaying output. Procedures are used for handling converting the string of ASCII code to a decimal representation, storing these decimal values in an array, and then another procedure handles converting the values in the array back to ASCII code so they can be outputted to the screen.

Memory addressing was used to access and manipulate memory locations where the user input and output data is stored. Pointers were used to keep track of the memory addresses of the data being processed, and to pass data between procedures. The program uses memory addressing and pointers to convert the ASCII representation of numbers to their decimal value, store the decimal values in an array, and then convert the decimal values back to ASCII for output. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how data is stored and manipulated at the machine level, and are essential for writing efficient and optimized assembly code."

The numerical values are stored in an array for further processing. Next, the program calculates the sum and average of the numerical values, and converts the results back to ASCII characters for output. This is done by adding the ASCII value of '0' to each numerical value to convert it back to ASCII. The converted ASCII characters are then displayed on the screen. This process demonstrates how data can be manipulated at the machine level using x86 Assembly to perform arithmetic operations and convert between different data representations."

In the TikTok Concerts project, React components were used to create the front-end of the web app, handling user interactions, state management, and data fetching. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM allowed for efficient rendering and updating of the UI based on user actions. In the Web Dev Portfolio project, React components were used to create interactive elements, manage the state of the application, and dynamically update the content of the portfolio website. React's declarative and composable nature made it easy to build complex UIs and maintain the application's state and logic. Overall, React's versatility and performance optimizations made it a suitable choice for building the front-end of these projects."
